Enhancement: Add support for custom domains while uploading to Microsoft Blob Storage

Restic did not support custom domains for Microsoft Storage Accounts when using
the `azure` storage backend. It now allows users to specify the `AZURE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`
environment variable to specify the custom domain of their Microsoft Storage Account.
