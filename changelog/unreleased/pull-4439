Enhancement: Use http connections when explicitly specified for Azure Storage Services

Restic only allowed HTTPs connections to Azure Storage Services when using
the `azure` storage backend. It now permits users to provide an extended option
`-o azure.usehttp=true` to explicitly specify to use HTTP connections. This will
allow users who have disabled `Secure Transfer Required` on Azure Stoage accounts
to backup and restore over HTTP connections.
